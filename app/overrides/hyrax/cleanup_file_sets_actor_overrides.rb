    def cleanup_file_sets(curation_concern)
      # From the get-go we've had orphaned FileSets from slow and brittle code in this actor
      # The stock version linked above is completely incapable of successfully deleting a Monograph...
      # with (roughly) over 200 FileSets attached
      #
      # Heliotrope changes
      # 1) actually pull the list of FileSets IDs from Solr, quickly
      # 2) don't worry about the callbacks that are all about allowing a FileSet to be attached to multiple works. See:
      #    https://github.com/samvera/hydra-works/blob/a8b4e0b4b3e0f1295a06a76ce46df8b0678d4910/lib/hydra/works/models/concerns/file_set_behavior.rb#L26
      #    https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/commit/786f609ebbc9b778b14ca269cd689fed6021d2a8#diff-b953f0e618614244acf67222ab315a8a
      #    Last time I checked, there is no way to attach a FileSet to multiple works in the Hyrax UI. We never intend
      #    to do it.
      #    It's more important that Work deletion actually succeeds than to preserve unavailable PCDM functionality
      #    once you've settled on this point, 3 and 4 become possible and make this thing work
      # 3) don't delete list_source in this actor. It's a slow thing to do in-line, also it's the first point of failure
      #    for us, especially in production on large Works. Either the request becomes too large or there is an
      #    unhandled runtime error
      # 4) call delete rather than destroy on the FileSets, to avoid the pointless callback
      # 5) do said deletion in a job to allow other actors to proceed and, ultimately, the page to reload
